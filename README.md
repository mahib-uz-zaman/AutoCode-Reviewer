# AutoCode Reviewer

A lightweight **local Python code review and testing tool** built with **Streamlit** and **Ollama** (Mistral model).  
This app analyzes, reviews, and tests Python scripts — all running **entirely on your local machine**.

## Features

- **Local Code Analysis** — Uses the Mistral model (via Ollama) for structural and logic feedback.
- **Syntax Checking** — Detects syntax issues using Python’s built-in `ast` module.
- **Runtime Testing** — Executes user-provided code safely and reports any runtime errors.
- **Offline Operation** — No external APIs; everything runs locally.
